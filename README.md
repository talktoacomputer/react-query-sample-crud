## FAQs [^1]

- Is this your first Todo App?
> No. Nobody in their right mind would actually upload their todo app unless they want to share it with someone. Todo apps are usually someone's first app in that tech stack. This isn't my first Todo app.

- Then, what is the purpose of this app?
> I wanted to test out the [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) library that everyone is hyping about. 
> I wanted to see if it's really what people claim it to be - a `useEffect` killer for React.  And, it is.

- What features are included in the app?
> You can do all of the following: 

    - Read all todos in one place
    - Add a new todo
    - Mark a todo as complete/incomplete
    - Delete an existing todo
    - ~~Edit the content of a todo~~   
    
> I simply didn't care enough to add that last feature. You can fork this project and add it.

- Does it have a backend?
> Yes. Please head to [Simple Todo REST API](https://github.com/talktoacomputer/node-todo-rest-api) which was the backend used to build this app.

- I noticed all code is written inside a single file (App.jsx). Why?
> I usually go bananas making well structured files and code. But, not this time. I wanted to take it easy and have everything at one place to keep it simple and manageable. Again, the purpose of this project was to just test the library.
